Write a program that prints the text "HELLO WORLD" to the console (stdout).

----------------------------------------------------------------------
## HINTS

To make a Node.js program, start writing JavaScript in the editor on the right! Execute your program by running it with the
`node` command in the Terminal window. e.g.:

```sh
$ node program.js
```

You can write to the console in the same way as in the browser:

```js
console.log("text")
```

When you are done, you may hit `Submit` button to proceed.

Your program will be tested, a report will be generated, and the lesson will be marked 'completed' if you are successful.
